**Description**   

This is a highly readable user style for the Stylish Firefox plugin.  
  
**Requirements**  

Important:  For this style to work properly, you must have "Perpetua", "Segoe UI", "Georgia" and "Courier New" fonts installed.  
If you do not have the font "Perpetua", you should install it, otherwise it all does not make much sense.

**Usage**  
- install the Stylish plugin for Firefox
- click on the plugin icon (big S in the right upper corner)
- select "Manage styles" 
- click "Write New Style" (or Edit if you edit an existing style file)
- copypaste the context of "greengray.css" into the edit window and save it
