**Description**   

This is a highly readable user style for Stylish Firefox plugin.  
  
**Requirements**  

Important:  For this style to work properly, you must have "Perpetua", "Segoe UI", "Georgia" and "Courier New" fonts installed.  
If you do not have the font "Perpetua", you should install it, otherwise it all does not make much sense.

**Usage**  
- install the Stylish plugin for Firefox
- click on the plugin icon, select "manage styles" -> "Write New Style" 
- copypaste the context of "greengray.css" into the edit window and save it
